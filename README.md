1. Overview, Descriptive Statistics, Visualization

2. Introduction to Probability

3. Conditional Probability & Bayes' Theorem

4. Introduction to Probability Distributions

5. Discrete Probability Distributions

6. Normal Distribution & Approximations

7. Sampling Techniques & Sampling Distributions

8. Parameter Estimation & Central Limit Theorem

9. Making Predictions with Probabilistic Models

10. Statistical Testing in Python - Hypothesis, Parametric, and Nonparametric Testing
